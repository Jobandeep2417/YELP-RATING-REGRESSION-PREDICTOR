    "# Project: Yelp Rating Regression Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurant industry is tougher than ever, with restaurant reviews blazing across the Internet from day one of a restaurant's opening. But as a lover of food, you and your friend decide to break into the industry and open up your own restaurant, Danielle's Delicious Delicacies. Since a restaurant's success is highly correlated with its reputation, you want to make sure Danielle's Delicious Delicacies has the best reviews on the most queried restaurant review site: Yelp! While you know your food will be delicious, you think there are other factors that play into a Yelp rating and will ultimately determine your business's success. With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp ratings, you decide to use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating and predict the Yelp rating for your restaurant!\n",

    "In this project we'll be working with a real dataset provided by Yelp. We have provided six files, listed below with a brief description:\n",

    "* `yelp_review.json`: Yelp review metadata by business\n",
    "* `yelp_user.json`: user profile metadata by business\n",

Remember, a correlation of `0` indicates that two features have no linear relationship, a correlation coefficient of `1` indicates two features have a perfect positive linear relationship, and a correlation coefficient of `-1` indicates two features have a perfect negative linear relationship. Call `.corr()` on `df`. You'll see that `number_funny_votes` has a correlation coefficient of `0.001320` with respect to `stars`, our Yelp rating. This is a very weak correlation.

Remember, R^2 is the coefficient of determination, or a measure of how much of the variance in our dependent variable, the predicted Yelp rating, is explained by our independent variables, our feature data. R^2 values range from `0` to `1`, with `0` indicating that the created model does not fit our data at all, and with `1` indicating the model perfectly fits our feature data. Call `.score()` on our model with `X_train` and `y_train` as parameters to calculate our training R^2 score.
